Of course, there exists a technique used to bypass this protective countermeasure
This technique is known as returning into libc
libc is a standard C library that contains various basic functions, such as printf() and exit()
These functions are shared, so any program that uses the printf() function directs execution into the appropriate function in libc
The functionality of such an exploit is limited by the function in libc, which is a significant restriction when compared to arbitrary shellcode
However, nothing is ever executed on the stack
