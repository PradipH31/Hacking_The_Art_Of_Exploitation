The aforementioned IDS or IPS systems can do more than just track connections-- they can also inspect the packets themselves
Usually, these systems are looking for patterns that would signify an attack
For example, a simple rule looking for packets that contain the string /bin/sh would catch a lot of packets containing shellcode
Our /bin/sh string is already slightly obfuscated since it's pushed to the stack in 4-byte chunks, but a network IDS could also look for packets that contain the strings /bin and //sh

These types of network IDS signatures can be fairly effective at catching script kiddies who are using exploits they downloaded from the internet
However, they are easily bypassed with a custom shellcode that hides any telltale strings
