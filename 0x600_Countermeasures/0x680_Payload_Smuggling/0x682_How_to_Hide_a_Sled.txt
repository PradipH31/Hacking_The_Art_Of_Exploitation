The NOP sled is another signature easy to detect by network IDSes and IPSes
Large blocks of 0x90 aren't that common, so if a network security mechanism sees something like this, it's probably an exploit
To avoid this signature, we can use different single-byte instructions instead of NOP
There are several 1-byte instructions-- the increment and decrement instructions for various registers-- that are also printable ASCII characters

_____________________________
Instruction    Hex    ASCII

inc eax        0x40     @

inc ebx        0x43     C

inc ecx        0x41     A

inc edx        0x42     B

dec eax        0x48     H

dec ebx        0x48     K

dec ecx        0x49     I

dec edx        0x4A     J

Since we zero out these registers before we use them, we can safely use a random combination of these bytes for the NOP sled
Creating a new exploit tool that uses random combinations of the bytes @, C, A, B, H, K, I, and J instead of a regular NOP sled will be left as an exercise for the reader
The easiest way for this would be writing a sled-generation program in C, which is used with a BASH script
This modification will hide the exploit buffer from IDSes that look for a NOP sled
