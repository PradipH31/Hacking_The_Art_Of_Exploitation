A type of co-evolution happens with hackers
Their exploit techniques have been around for years, so it's only natural that defensive countermeasures would develop
In response, hackers find ways to bypass and subvert these defenses, and then new defense techniques are created

This cycle of innovation is actually quite beneficial
Even though the viruses and worms can cause quite a bit of trouble and costly interruptions for businesses, they force a response, which fixes the problem
Worms replicate by exploiting existing vulnerabilities in flawed software
Often these flaws are undiscovered for years, but relatively benign worms such as CodeRed or Sasser force these problems to be fixed
As with chickenpox, it's better to suffer a minor outbreak early instead of years later when it can cause real damage
If it weren't for Internet worms making a public spectacle of these security flaws, they might remain unpatched, leaving us vulnerable to an attack from someone with more malicious goals than just replication
In this way, worms and viruses can actually strengthen security in the long run
However, there are more proactive ways to strengthen security
Defensive countermeasures exist which try to nullify the effect of an attack, or prevent the attack from happening
A countermeasure is a fairly abstract concept; this could be a security product, a set of policies, a program, or simply just an attentive system administrator
These defensive countermeasures can be separated into 2 groups: those that try to detect the attack and those that try to protect the vulnerability
