As always, details can be hidden in the bigger picture
A single host usually exists within some sort of infrastructure
Countermeasures such as intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) can detect abnormal network traffic
Even simple log files on routers and firewalls can reveal abnormal connections that are indicative of an intrusion
In particular, the connection to port 31337 used in our connect-back shellcode is a big red flag
We could change the port to something that looks less suspucious; however, simply having a webserver open outbound connections could be a red flag by itself
A highly secure infrastructure might even have the firewall setup with egress filters to prevent outbound connections
In these situations, opening a new connection is either impossible or will be detected
