The first group of countermeasures tries to detect the intrusion and respond in some way
The detection process could be anything from an administrator reading logs to a program sniffing the network
The response might include killing the connection or process automatically, or just the administrator scrutinizing everything from the machine's console

As a system administrator, the exploits you know about aren't as nearly as dangerous as the ones you don't
The sooner an intrusion is detected, the sooner it can be dealt with and the more likely it can be contained
Intrusions that aren't discovered for months can be cause for concern

The way to detect an intrusion is to anticipate what the attacking hacker is going to do
If you know that, then you know what to look for
Countermeasures that detect can look for these attack patterns in log files, network packets, or even program memory
After an intrusion is detected, the hacker can be expunged from the system, any filesystem damage can be undone by restoring from backup, and the exploited vulnerability can be identified and patched
Detecting countermeasures are quite powerful in an electronic world with backup and restore capabilities

For the attacker, this means detection can counteract everything he does
Since the detection might not always be immediate, there are a few "smash and grab" scenarios where it doesn't matter; however, even then it's better not to leave tracks
Stealth is one of the hacker's most valuable assets
Exploiting a vulnerable program to get a root shell means you can do whatever you want on the system, but avoiding detection additionally means no one knows you're there
The combination of "God mode" and invisibility makes for a dangerous hacker
From a concealed position, passwords and data can be quietly sniffed from the network, programs can be backdoored, and further attacks can be launched on other hosts
To stay hidden, you simply need to anticipate the detection methods that might be used
If you know what they are looking for, you can avoid certain exploit patterns or mimic valid ones
The co-evolutionary cycle between hiding and detecting is fueled by thinking of the things the other side hasn't thought of
