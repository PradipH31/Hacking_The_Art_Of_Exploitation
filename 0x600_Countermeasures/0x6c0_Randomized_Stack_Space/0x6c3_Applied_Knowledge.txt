Situations like this are what makes hacking an art
The state of computer security is a constantly changing landscape, and specific vulnerabilities are discovered and patched everyday
However, if you understand the concepts of the core hacking techniques explained in this book, you can apply them in new and inventive ways to solve the probelm du jour
Like LEGO bricks, these techniques can be used in millions of different combinations and configurations
As with any art, the more you practice these techniques, the better you'll understand them
With this understanding comes the wisdom to guesstimate offsets and recognize memory segments by their address ranges

In this case, the problem is still ASLR
Hopefully, you  have a few bypass ideas you might want to try out now
Don'y be afraid to use the debugger to examine what is actually happening
There are probably several ways to bypass ASLR, and you may invent a new technique
If you don't find a solution, don't worry-- I'll explain a method in the next section
But it's worthwhile to think about this problem a little on your own before reading ahead
