A hybrid cryptosystem gets the best of both worlds
An asymmetric cipher is used to exchange a randomly generated key that is used to encrypt the remaining communications with a symmetric cipher
This provides the speed and efficiency of a symmetric cipher, while solving the dilemma of secure key exchange
Hybrid ciphers are used by most modern cryptographic applications, such as SSL, SSH and PGP

Since most applications use ciphers that are resistant to cryptanalysis, attacking the cipher usually won't work
However, if an attacker can intercept communications between both parties and masquerade as one or the other, the key exchange algorithm can be attacked
