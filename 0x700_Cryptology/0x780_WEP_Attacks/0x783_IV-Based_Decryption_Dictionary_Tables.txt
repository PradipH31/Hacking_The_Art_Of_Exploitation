After plaintexts are recovered for an intercepted message, the keystream for that IV will also be known
This means that this keystream can be used to decrypt any other packet with the same IV, providing it's not longer than the recovered keystream
Over time, it's possible to create a table of keystreams indexed by every possible IV
Since there are only 2^24 possible IVs, if 1500 bytes of keystream are saved for each IV, the table would only require about 24GB of storage
Once a table like this is created, all subsequent encrypted packets can be easily be decrypted

Realistically, this method of attack would be very time consuming and tedious
It's an interesting idea, but there are much easier ways to defeat WEP
