In all fairness, it was never meant to be a strong cryptographic protocol, but rather a way to provide a wired equivalency, as alluded to by the acronym
Aside from the security weaknesses relating to association and identities, there are several problems with the cryptographic protocol itself
Some of these problems stem from the use of CRC32 as a checksum function for message integrity, and other problems stem from the way IVs are used
