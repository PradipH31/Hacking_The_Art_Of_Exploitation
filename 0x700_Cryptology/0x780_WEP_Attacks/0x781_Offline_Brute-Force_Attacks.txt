Brute forcing will always be a possible attack on any computationally secure cryptosystem
The only question that remains is whether it's a practical attack or not
With WEP, the actual method of offline brute forcing is simple:
Capture a few packets, then try to decrypt the packets using every possible key
Next, recalculate the checksum for the packet, and compare this with the original checksum
If they match, then that's most likely the key
Usually, this needs to be done with at least 2 packets, since it's likely that a single packet can be decrypted with an invalid key yet the checksum will still be valid

However, under the assumption of 10,000 cracks per second, brute forcing through the 40-bit keyspace would take over 3 years
Realistically, modern processors can achieve more that 10,000 cracks per second, but even at 200,000 cracks per second, this would take a few months
Depending on the resources and dedication of an attacker, this type of attack may or may not be feasible

Tim Newsham has provided an effective cracking method that attacks weakness in the password-based generatoin algorithm that is used by most 40-bit (marketed as 64-bit) cards and access points
His method effectively reduces the 40-bit keyspace down to 21 bits, which can be cracked in a matter of minutes under the assumption of 10,000 cracks per second (and in a matter of seconds on a modern processor)

For 104-bit(marketed as 128-bit) WEP networks, brute-forcing just isn't feasible
