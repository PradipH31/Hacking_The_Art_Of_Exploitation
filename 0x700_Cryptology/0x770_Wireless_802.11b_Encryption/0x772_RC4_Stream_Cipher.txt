RC4 is a surprisingly simple algorithm
It consists of 2 algorithms: the Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA) and the Pseudo-Random Generation Algorithm (PRGA)
Both of these algorithms use an 8-by-8 S-box, which is just an array of 256 numbers that are both unique and range in value from 0 to 255
Stated simply, all the numbers from 0 to 255 exist in the array, but they're all jsut mixed up in different ways
The KSA does the initial scrambling of the S-box, based on the seed value fed into it, and the seed can be up to 256 bits long

First, the S-box array is filled with sequential values from 0 to 255
This array will be aptly named S
Then, another 256-byte array is filled with the seed value, repeating as necessary until the entire array is filled
This array will be named K
Then the S array is scrambled using the following psuedo-code

__________________________________________________________________________________
j = 0;
for i = 0 to 255
{
   j  = (j + S[i] + K[i]) mod 256;
   swap S[i] and S[j];
}
__________________________________________________________________________________

Once that is done, the S-box is all mixed up based on the seed value
That's the key scheduling algorithm
Pretty simple

Now when keystream data is needed, the Pseudo-Random Generation Algorithm (PRGA) is used
This algorithm has 2 counters, i and j, which are both initialized at 0 to begin with
After that, for each byte of keystream data, the following psuedo-code is used
__________________________________________________________________________________
i = (i + 1) mod 256;
j = (j + S[i]) mod 256;
swap S[i] and S[j];
t = (S[i] + S[j]) mod 256;
Output the value of S[t];
__________________________________________________________________________________

The outputted byte of S[t] is the first byte of the keystream
This algorithm is repeated for additional keystream bytes

RC4 is simple enough that it can be easily memorized and implemented on the fly, and it is quite secure if used properly
However, there are a few problems with the way RC4 is used for WEP
