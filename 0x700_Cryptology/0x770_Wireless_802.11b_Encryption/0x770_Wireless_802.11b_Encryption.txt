Wireless 802.11b security has been a big issue, primarily due to the absence of it
Weaknesses in Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), the encryption method used for wireless, contribute greatly to the overall insecurity
There are other details, sometimes ignored during wireless deployments, which can also lead to major vulnerabilities

The fact that wireless networks exist on layer 2 is one of these details
If the wireless network isn't VLANed off or firewalled, an attacker associated to the wireless access point could redirect all the wired network traffic out over the wireless via ARP redirection
This, coupled with the tendency to hook wireless access points to internal private networks, can lead to some serious vulnerabilities

Of course, if WEP is turned on, only clients with the proper WEP key will be allowed to associate to the access point
If WEP is secure, there shouldn't be any concern about rogue attackers associating and causing havoc
This begs the question, "How secure is WEP?"
