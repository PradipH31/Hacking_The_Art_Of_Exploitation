Asymmetric ciphers use 2 keys: a public key and a private key
The public key is made public, while the private key is kept private; hence, the clever names
Any message that is encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key
This removes the issue of key distribution-- public keys are public, and by using the public key, a message can be encrypted for the corresponding private key
Unlike symmetric ciphers, there's no need for an out-of-band communication channel to transmit the secret key
However, asymmetric ciphers tend to be quite a bit slower than symmetric ciphers
