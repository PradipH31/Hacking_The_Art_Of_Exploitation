Symmetric ciphers are cryptosystems that use the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages
The encryption and decryption process is generally faster than with asymmetric encryption, but key distribution can be difficult

These ciphers are generally either block ciphers or stream ciphers
A block cipher operates on blocks of a fixed size, usually 64 or 128 bits
The same block of plaintext will always encrypt to the same ciphertext block, using the same key
DES, Blowfish, and AES (Rijmdael) are all block ciphers
Stream ciphers generate a stream of pseudo-random bits, usually either one bit or byte at a time
This is called the keystream, and it is XORed with the plaintext
This is useful for encrypting continuous stream of data
RC4 and LSFR are examples of popular stream ciphers

DES and AES are both popular block ciphers
A lot of thought goes into the construction of block ciphers to make them resistant to known cryptanalysis attacks
2 concepts used repeatedly in block ciphers are confusion and diffusion
Confusion refers to methods used to hide relationships between the plaintext, the ciphertext, and the key
This means that the output bits must involve some complex transformation of the key and plaintext
Diffusion serves to spread the influence of the plaintext bits and the key bits over as much of the ciphertext as possible
Product ciphers combine both of these concepts by using various simple operations repeatedly
Both DES and AES are product ciphers

DES also uses a Feistel network
It is used in many block ciphers to ensure that the algorithm is invertible
Basically, each block is divided into 2 halves, left (L) and right (R)
Then, in one round of operation, the new left half (L i), is set to be equal to the old right half (R i-1), and the new right half (R i) is made up of the old left half (L i-1) XORed with the output of a function using the old right half (R i-1) and the subkey for that round (K i)
Usually, each round of operation has a separate subkey, which is calculated earlier

The values for (L i) and (R i) are as follows (the ⊕ symbol denotes the XOR operation)
   (L i) = (R i-1)
   (R i) = (L i-1) ⊕ f((R i-1), (K i))


DES uses 16 rounds of operation
This number was specifically chosen to defend against differential cryptanalysis
DES's only real known weakness is its key size
Since the key is only 56 bits, the entire keyspace can be checked in an exhaustive brute-force attack in a few weeks on specialized hardware

Triple-DES fixes this problem by using 2 DES keys concatenated together for a total key size of 112 bits
Encryption is done by encrypting the plaintext block with the first key, then decrypting with the second key, and then encrypting again with the first key
Decryption is done analogously, but with the encryption and decryption operation switched
The added key size makes a brute-force effort exponentially more difficult

Most industry-standard block ciphers are resistant to all known forms of cryptanalysis, and the key sizes are usually too big to attempt an exhaustive brute-force attack
However, quantum computation provides some interesting possibilities, which are generally overhyped
