Quantum computation gives the promise of massive parallelism
A quantum computer can store many different states in superposition (which can be thought of as an array) and perform calculations on all of them at once
This is ideal for brute forcing anything, including block ciphers
The superposition can be loaded up with every possible key, and then the encryption operation can be performed on all the keys at the same time
The tricky part is getting the right value out of the superposition
Quantum computers are weird in that when the superposition is looked at, the whole thing decoheres into a single state
Unfortunately, this decoherence is initially random, and the odds of decohering into each state in the superposition are equal

Without some way to manipulate the odds of the superposition states, the same effect could be achieved by just guessing keys
Fortunately, a man named Lov Grover came up with an algorithm that can manipulate the odds of the superposition states
This algorithm allows the odds of a certain desired state to increase while the others decrease
This process is repeated several times until the decohering of the superposition into the desired state is nearly guaranteed
This takes about O(n^(1/2)) steps

Using some basic exponential math skills, you will notice that this just effectively halves the key size for an exhaustive brute-force attack
So, for the ultra paranoid, doubling the key size of a block cipher will make it resistant to even the theoretical possibilites of an exhaustive brute-force attack with a computer
