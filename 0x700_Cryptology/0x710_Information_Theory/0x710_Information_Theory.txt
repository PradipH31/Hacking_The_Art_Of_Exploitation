Many of the concepts of cryptographic security stem from the mind of Claude Shannon
His ideas have influenced the field of cryptography greatly, especially the concepts of diffusion and confusion
Although the following concepts on unconditional security, one-time pads, quantum key distribution, and computational security weren't actually conceived by Shannon, his ideas on perfect secrecy and information theory had great influence on the definitions of security
