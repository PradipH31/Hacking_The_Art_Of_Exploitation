The advent of quantum computing brings many interesting things to the field of cryptology
One of these is a practical implementation of the one-time pad, made possible by quantum key distribution
The mystery of quantum entanglement can provide a reliable and secret method of sending a random string of bits that can be used as a key
This is done using nonorthogonal quantum states in photons

Without going into too much detail, the polarization of a photon is the oscillation direction of its electric field, which in this case can be along the horizontal, vertical, or one of the 2 diagonals
Nonorthogonal simply means the states are separated by an angle that isn't 90 degrees
Curiously enough, it's impossible to determine with certainty which of these 4 polarizations a single photon has
The rectilinear basis of the horizontal and vertical polarizations is incompatible with the diagonal basis of the 2 diagonal polarizations, so, due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, these 2 sets of polarizations cannot both be measured
Filters can be used to measure the polarizations-- one for the rectilinear basis and one for the diagonal basis
When a photon passes through the correct filter, its polarization won't change, but if it passes through the incorrect filter, its polarization will be randomly modified
This means that any eavesdropping attempts to measure the polarization of a photon has a good chance of scrambling the data, making it apparent that the channel isn't secure

These strange aspects of quantum mechanics were put to good use by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard in the first and probably best-known quantum key distribution scheme, called BB84
First, the sender and receiver agree on bit representation for the 4 polarizations, such that each basis has both 1 and 0
In this scheme, 1 could be represented by both vertical photon polarization and one of the diagonal polarizations (positive 45 degrees), while 0 could be represented by horizontal polarization and the other diagonal polarization (negative 45 degrees)
This way, 1s and 0s can exist when the rectilinear polarization is measured and when the diagonal polarization is measured

Then, the sender sends a stream of random photons, each coming from a randomly chosen basis (either rectilinear or diagonal), and these photons are recorded
When the receiver receives a photon, he also randomly chooses to measure it in either the rectilinear basis or the diagonal basis and records the result
Now, the 2 parties publicly compare which basis they used for each photon, and they keep only the data corresponding to the photons they both measured using the same basis
This doesn't reveal the bit values of the photons, since there are both 1s and 0s in each basis
This makes up the key for the one-time pad

Since an eavesdropper would ultimately end up changing the polarization of some of these photons and thus scramble the data, eavesdropping can be detected by computing the error rate of some random subset of the key
If there are too many errors, someone was probably eavesdropping, and the key should be thrown away
If not, the transmission of the key data was secure and private
