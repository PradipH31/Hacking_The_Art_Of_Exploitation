One example of an unconditionally secure cryptosystem is the one-time pad
A one-time pad is a very simple cryptosystem that uses blocks of random data called pads
The pad must be at least as long as the plaintext message that is to be encoded, and the random data on the pad must be truly random, in the most literal sense of the word
2 identical pads are made: one for the recipient and one for the sender
To encode a message, the sender simply XORs each bit of the plaintext message with the corresponding bit of the pad
After the message is encoded, the pad is destroyed to ensure that it is only used once
Then the encrypted message can be sent to the recipient without fear of cryptanalysis, since the encrypted message cannot be broken without the pad
When the recipient receives the encrypted message, he also XORs each bit of the encrypted message with the corresponding bit of the pad to produce the original plaintext message

While the one-time pad is theoretically impossible to break, in reality it's not really all that practical to use
The security of the one-time pad hinges on the security of the pads
When the pads are distributed to the recipient and the sender, it is assumed that the pad transmission channel is secure
To be truly secure, this could involve a face-to-face meeting and exchange, but for convenience, the pad transmission may be facilitated via yet another cipher
The price of this convenience is that the entire system is now only as strong as the weakest link, which would be the cipher used to transmit the pads
Since the pad consists of random data of the same length as the plaintext message, and since the security of the whole system is only as good as the security of pad transmission, it usually makes more sense to just send the plaintext message encoded using the same cipher that would have been used to transmit the pad
