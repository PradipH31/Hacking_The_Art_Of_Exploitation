A cryptosystem is considered to be computationally secure if the best-known algorithm for breaking it requires an unrealistic amount of computational resources and time
This means that it is theoretically possible for an eavesdropper to break the encryption, but it is practically infeasible to actually do so, since the amount of time and resources necessary would far exceed the value of the encrypted information
Usually, the time needed to break a computationally secure cryptosystem is measured in tens of thousands of years, even with the assumption of a vast array of computational resources
Most modern cryptosystems fall into this category

It's important to note that the best-known algorithms for breaking cryptosystems are always evolving and being improved
Ideally, a cryptosystem would be defined as computationally secure if the best algorithm for breaking it requires an unreasonable amount of computational resources and time, but there is currently no way to prove that a given encryption-breaking algorithm is and always will be the best one
So, the current best-known algorithm is used instead to measure a cryptosystem's security
