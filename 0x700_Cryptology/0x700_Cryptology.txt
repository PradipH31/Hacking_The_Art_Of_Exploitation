Cryptology is defined as the study of cryptography or cryptanalysis
Cryptography is simply the process of communicating secretly through the use of ciphers, and cryptanalysis is the process of cracking or deciphering such secret communications
Historically, cryptology has been of particular interest during wars, when countries used secret codes to communicate with their troops while also trying to break the enemy's codes to infiltrate their communications

The wartime applications still exist, but the use of cryptography in civilian life is becoming increasingly popular as more critical transactions occur over the Internet
Network sniffing is so common that the paranoid assumption that someone is always sniffing network traffic might not be so paranoid
Passwords, credit card numbers, and other proprietary information can all be sniffed and stolen over unencrypted protocols
Encrypted communication protocols provide a solution to this lack of privacy and allow the Internet economy to function
Without Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption, credit card transactions at popular websites would be either very inconvenient or insecure

All of this private data is protected by cryptographic algorithms that are probably secure
Currently, cryptosystems that can be proven to be secure are far too unwieldy for practical use
So in lieu of a mathematical proof of security, cryptosystems that are practically secure are used
This means that it's possible that shortcuts for defeating these ciphers exist, but no one's been able to actualize them yet
Of course, there are also cryptosystems that aren't secure at all
This could be due to the implementation, key size, or simply cryptanalytic weakness in the cipher itself
In 1997, under US law, the maximum allowable key size for encryption in exported software was 40 bits
This limit on key size makes the corresponding cipher insecure, as was shown by RSA Data Security and Ian Goldberg, a graduate student from the University of California, Berkeley
RSA posted a challenge to decipher a message encrypted with a 40-bit key, and 3 and a half hours later, Ian had done just that
This was strong evidence that 40-bit keys aren't large enough for a secure cryptosystem

Cryptology is relevant to hacking in a number of ways
At the purest level, the challenge of solving a puzzle is enticing to the curious
At a more nefarious level, the secret data protected by that puzzle is perhaps even more alluring
Breaking or circumventing the cryptographic protection of secret data can provide a certain sense of satisfaction, not to mention a sense of the protected data's contents
In addition, strong cryptography is useful in avoiding detection
Expensive network intrusion detection systems designed to sniff network traffic for attack signatures are useless if the attacker is using an encrypted communication channel
Often, the encrypted Web access provided for customer security is used by attackers as a difficult-to-monitor attack vector
