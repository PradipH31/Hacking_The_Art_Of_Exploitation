Another crashing DOS attack that came about for the same reason was called teardrop
Teardrop exploited another weakness in several vendor's implementations of IP fragmentation reassembly
Usually, when a packet is fragmented, the offsets stored in the header will line up to reconstruct the original packet with no overlap
The teardrop attacks sent packet fragments with overlapping offsets, which caused implementations that didn't check for this irregular condition to inevitably crash

Although this specific attack doesn't work anymore, understanding the concept can reveal problems in other areas
Although not limited to a Denial of Service, a recent remote exploit in the OpenBSD kernel (which prides itself on security) had to do with fragmented IPv6 packets
IP version 6 uses more complicated headers and even a different IP address format than the IPv4 most people are familiar with
Often, the same mistakes made in the past are repeated by early implementations of new products
