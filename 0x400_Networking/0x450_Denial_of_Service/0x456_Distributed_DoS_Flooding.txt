A distributed DoS (DDoS) attack is a distributed version of a flooding DoS attack
Since bandwidth consumption is the goal of a flooding DoS attack, the more bandwidth the attacker is able to work with, the more damage they can do
In a DDoS attack, the attacker first compromises a number of other hosts and installs daemons on them
Systems installed with such software are commonly referred to as bots and make up what is known as a botnet
These bots wait patiently until the attacker picks a victim and all of the bots simultaneously attack the victim with some form of flooding DoS attack
Not only does the great number of distributed hosts multiply the effect of the flooding, this also makes tracing the attack source much mroe difficult
