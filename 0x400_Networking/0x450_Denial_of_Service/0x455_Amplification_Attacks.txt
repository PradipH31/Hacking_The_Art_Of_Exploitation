There are actually some clever ways to perform a ping flood without using massive amounts of bandwidth
An amplification attack uses spoofing and broadcast addressing to amplify a single stream of packets by a hundred-fold
First, a target amplification system must be found
This is a network that allows communication to the broadcast address and has a relatively high number of active hosts
Then the attacker sends large ICMP echo request packets to the broadcast address of the amplification network, with a spoofed source address of the victim's system
The amplifier will broadcast these packets to all the hosts on the amplification network, which will then send corresponding ICMP echo reply packets to the spoofed source address (i.e., to the victim's machine)

This amplification of traffic allows the attacker to send a relatively small stream of ICMP echo request packets out, while the victim gets swamped with up to a couple hundred times as many ICMP echo reply packets
This attack can be done with both ICMP packets and UDP echo packets
These techniques are known as smurf and fraggle attacks, respectively
