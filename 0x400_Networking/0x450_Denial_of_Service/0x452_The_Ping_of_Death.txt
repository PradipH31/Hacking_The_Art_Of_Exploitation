According to the specification for ICMP, ICMP echo messages can only have 2^16, or 65,536 bytes of data in the data part of the packet
The data portion of ICMP packets is commonly overlooked, since the important information is in the header
Several operating systems crashed if they were sent ICMP echo messages that exceeded the size specified
An ICMP echo message of this gargantuan size became affectionately known as "The Ping of Death"
It was a very simple hack exploiting a vulnerability that existed because no one ever considered this possibility
It should be easy for us to write a program using libnet that can perform this attack; however, it won't be that useful in the real world
Modern systems are all patched against this vulnerability

However, history tends to repeat itself
Even though oversized ICMP packets won't crash computers anymore, new technologies sometimes suffer from similar problems
The Bluetooth protocol, commonly used with phones, has a similar ping packet on the L2CAP layer, which is also used to measure the communication time on established links
Many implementations of Bluetooth suffer form the same oversized ping packet problem
Adma Laurie, Marcel Hotlmann, and Martin Herfurt have dubbed this attack Bluesmack and have released source code by that same name that performs this attacks
