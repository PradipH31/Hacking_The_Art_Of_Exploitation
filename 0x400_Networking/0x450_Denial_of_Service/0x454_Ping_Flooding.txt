Flooding DoS attacks don't try to necessarily crash a service or resource, but instead try to overload it so it can't respond
Similar attacks can tie up other resources, such as CPU cycles and system processes, but a flooding attack specifically tries to tie up a network resource

The simplest form of flooding is just a ping flood
The goal is to use up the victim's bandwidth so that legitimate traffic can't get through
The attacker sends many large ping packets to the victim, which eat away at the bandwidth of the victim's network connection

There's nothing really clever about this attack-- it's just a battle of bandwidth
An attacker with greater bandwidth than a victim can send more data thant the victim can receive and therefore deny other legitimate traffic from getting to the victim
