One of the simplest forms of network attack is a Denial of Service(DoS) attack
Instead of trying to steal information, a DoS attack simply prevents access to a service or resource
There are 2 general forms of DoS attacks: those that crash services and those that flood services

Denial of Service attacks that crash services are actially more similar to program exploits than network-based exploits
Often, these attacks are dependent on a poor implementation by a specific vendor
A buffer overflow exploit gone wrong will usually just crash the target program instead of directing the execution flow to the injected shellcode
If this program happens to be on a server, then no one else can access that server after it has crashed
Crashing DoS attacks like this are closely tied to a certain version
Since the operating system handles the network stack, crashes in the code will take down the kernel, denying service to the entire machine
Many of these vulnerabilities have long since been patched on modern operating systems, but it's still useful to think about how these techniques might be applied to different situations
