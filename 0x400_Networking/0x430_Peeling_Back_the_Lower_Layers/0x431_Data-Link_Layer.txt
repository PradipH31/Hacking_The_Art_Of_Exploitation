The lowest visible layer is the data-link layer
Returning to the receptionist and bureaucracy analogy, if the physical layer below is thought of as inter-office mail carts and the network layer above as a worldwide postal system, in the data-link layer is the system of interoffice mail
This layer provides a way to address and send messages to anyone else in the office, as well as to figure out who's in the office

Ethernet exists on this layer, providing a standard addressing system for all Ethernet devices
These addresses are known as Media Access Control(MAC) addresses
Every Ethernet device is assigned a globally unique address consisting of 6 bytes, usually written in hexadecimal in the form of xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
These addresses are also sometimes referred as hardware addresses, since each address in unique to a piece of hardware and is stored in the device's integrated circuit memory
MAC addresses can be thought of as Social Security numbers for hardware, since each piece of hardware is supposed to have a unique MAC address

An Ethernet header is 14 bytes in size and contains the source and destination MAC addresses for this Ethernet packet
Ethernet addressing also provides a special broadcast address, consisiting of all binary 1's(ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)
Any Ethernet packet sent to this address will be sent to all the connected devices

The MAC address of a network device isn't meant to change, but its IP address may change regularly
The concept of IP addresses doesn't exist at this level, only hardware addresses do, so a method is needed to correlate the 2 addressing schemes
In the office, post office mail sent to an employee at the office's address goes to the appropriate desk
In Ethernet, the method is known as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

This protocol allows "seating charts" to be made to associate an IP address with a piece of hardware
There are 4 different types pf ARP messages, but the 2 most important types are ARP request messages and ARP reply messages
Any packet's Ethernet header includes a type value that describes the packet
This type is used to specify whether the packet is an ARP-type message or an IP packet

An ARP request is a message, sent to the broadcast address, that contains the sender's IP address and MAC address and basically says, "Hey, who has this IP? If it's you, please respond and tell me your MAC address"
An ARP reply is the corresponding response that is sent to the requester's MAC address (and IP address) saying, "This is my MAC address, and I have this IP address"
Most implementations will temporarily cache the MAC/IP address pairs received in ARP replies, so that ARP requests and replies aren't needed for every single packet
These caches are like the interoffice seating chart

For example, if a system has the IP address 10.10.10.20 and MAC address 00:00:00:aa:aa:aa and another system on the same network has the IP address 10.10.10.50 and MAC address 00:00:00:bb:bb:bb, neither system can communicate with the other until they know each other's MAC addresses

If the first system wants to establish a TCP connection over IP to the second device's IP address of 10.10.10.50, the first system will first check its ARP cache to see if an entry exists for 10.10.10.50
Since this is the first time these 2 systems are trying to communicate, there will be no such entry, and an ARP request will be sent out to the broadcast address, saying "If you are 10.10.10.50, please respond to me at 00:00:00:aa:aa:aa"
Since this request uses the broadcast address, every system on the network sees the request, but only the system with the corresponding IP address is meant to respond
In this case, the second system responds with an ARP reply that is sent directly back to 00:00:00:aa:aa:aa saying, "I am 10.10.10.50 and I'm at 00:00:00:bb:bb:bb"
The first system receives this reply, caches the IP and MAC address pair in its ARP cache, and uses the hardware address to communicate
