The network layer is like a worldwide postal service providing an addressing and delivery method used to send things everywhere
The protocol used at this layer for Internet addressing and delivery is, appropriately, called Internet Protocol(IP); the majority of the Internet uses IP version 4

Every system on the Internet has an IP address, consisting of a familiar 4-byte arrangement in the form of xx.xx.xx.xx
The IP header for packets in this layer is 20 bytes in size and consists of various fields and bitflags as defined in RFC 791

3.1.  Internet Header Format

  A summary of the contents of the internet header follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

  Note that each tick mark represents one bit position.

This surprisingly descriptive ASCII diagram shows these fields and their positions in the header
Standard protocols have awesome documentation
Similar to the Ethernet header, the IP header also has a protocol field to describe the type of data in the packet and source and destination address for routing
In addition, the header carries a checksum, to help detect transmission errors, and fields to deal with packet fragmentation

The Internet Protocol is mostly used to transmit packets wrapped in higher layers
However, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets also exist on this layer
ICMP packets are used for messaging and diagnostics
IP is less reliable than the post office- there's no guarantee that an IP packet will actually reach its final destination
If there's a problem, an ICMP packets is sent back to notify the sender of the problem

ICMP is also commonly used to test for connectivity
ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply messages are used by a utility called ping
If one host wants to test whether it can route traffic to another host, it pings the remote host by sending an ICMP Echo Request
Upon receipt of the ICMP Echo Request, the remote host sends back an ICMP Echo Reply
These messages can be used to determine the connection latency between the 2 hosts
However, it is important to remember that ICMP and IP are both connectionless; all this protocol layer really cares about is getting the packet to its destination address

Sometimes a network link will have a limitation on packet size, disallowing the transfer of large packets
IP can deal with this situation by fragmenting packets, as shown below:

Large IP packet
_____________________________________________________
| Header |   Data   |  Data continued  |   More data|
|________|__________|__________________|____________|

Packet fragments
_____________________
| Header |   Data   |
|________|__________|

_______________________________
| Header |   Data continued   |
|________|____________________|

__________________________
| Header |   More data   |
|________|_______________|

The packet is broken up into smaller packet fragments that can pass through the network link, IP headers are put on each fragment, and they're sent off
Each fragment has a different fragment offset value, which is stored in the header
When the destination receives these fragments, the offset values are used to reassemble the original IP packet

Provisions such as fragmentation aid in the delivery of IP packets, but this does nothing to maintain connections or ensure delivery
This is the job of the protocols at the transport layer
