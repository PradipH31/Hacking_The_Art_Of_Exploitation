In response to SYN scanning, new tools to detect and log half-open connections were created
So yet another collection of techniques for stealth port scanning evolved: FIN, X-mas, and NULL scans
These all involve sending a nonsensical packet to every port on the target system
If a port is listening, these packets just get ignored
However, if the port is closed and the implementation follows protocol (RFC 793), an RST packet will be sent
This difference can be used to detect which ports are accepting connections, without actually opening any connections

The FIN scan sends a FIN packet, the X-mas scan sends a packet with FIN, URG, and PUSH turned on (so named because the flags are lit up like a Christmas tree), and the NULL scan sends a packet with no TCP flags set
While these types of scans are stealthier, they can also be unreliable
For instance, Microsoft's implementation of TCP doesn't send RST packets like it should, making this form of scanning ineffective

Using nmap, FIN, X-mas, and NULL scans can be performed using the command-line options -sF, -sX, and -sN, respectively
Their output looks basically the same as the previous scan
