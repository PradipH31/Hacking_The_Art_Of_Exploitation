Another way to avoid detection is to hide among several decoys
This technique simply spoofs connections from various decoy IP addresses in between each real port-scanning connection
The responses from the spoofed connections aren't needed, since they are simply misleads
However, the spoofed decoy addresses must use real IP  addresses of live hosts; otherwise, the target may be accidentally SYN flooded

Decoys can be specified in nmap with -D command-line option
The sample nmap command shown below scans the IP 192.168.42.72, using 192.168.42.10 and 192.168.42.11 as decoys
