Port scanning is a way of figuring out which ports are listening and accepting connections
Since most services run on standard, documented ports, this information can be used to determine which services are running
The simplest form of port scanning involves trying to open TCP connections to every possible port on the target system
While this is effective, it's also noisy and detectable
Also, when connections are established, services will manually log the IP address
To avoid this, several clever techniques have been invented

A port scanning tool called nmap, written by Fyodor, implements all of the following port-scanning techniques
This tool has become one of the most popular open source port-scanning tools
