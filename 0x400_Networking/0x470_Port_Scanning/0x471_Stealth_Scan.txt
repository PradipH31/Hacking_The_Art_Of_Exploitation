A SYN scan is also sometimes called a half-scan
This is because it doesn't actually open a full TCP connection
Recall the TCP/IP handshake: When a full connection is made, first a SYN packet is sent, then a SYN/ACK packet is sent back, and finally and ACK packet is returned to complete the handshake and open the connection
A SYN scan doesn't complete the handshake, so a full connection is never opened
Instead, only the initial SYN packet is sent, and the response is examined
If a SYN/ACK packet is received in response, that port must be accepting connections
This is recorded, and an RST packet is sent to tear down the connection to prevent the service from accidently being DoSed

Using nmap, a SYN scan can be performed using the command-line option -sS
The program must be run as root, since the program isn't using standard sockets and needs raw network access
