TCP/IP hijcaking is a clever technique that uses spoofed packets to take over a connection between a victim and a host machine
This technique is exceptionally useful when the victim uses a one-time password to connect to the host machine
A one-time password can be used to authenticate once and only once, which means that sniffing the authentication is useless for the attacker

To carry out a TCP/IP hijacking attack, the attacker must be on the same network as the victim
By sniffing the local netwokr segment, all of the details of open TCP connections can be pulled from the headers
As we have seen, each TCP packet contains a sequence number in its header
This sequence number is incremented with each packet sent to ensure that packets are received in the correct order
While sniffing, the attacker has access to the sequence numbers for a connection between a victim (system A in the following illustration) and a host machine (system B)
Then the attacker sends a spoofed packet from the victim's IP address to the host machine, using the sniffed sequence number to provide the proper acknowledgement number

The host machine will receive the spoofed packet with the correct acknowledgement number and will have no reason to believe it didn't come from the victim
