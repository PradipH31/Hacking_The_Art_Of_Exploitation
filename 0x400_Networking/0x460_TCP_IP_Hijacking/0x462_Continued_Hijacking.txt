The spoofed packet doesn't need to be an RST packet
This attack becomes more interesting when the spoof packet contains data
The host machine receives the spoofed packet, increments the sequence number, and responds to the victim's IP
Since the victim's machine doesn't know about the spoofed packet, the host machine's response has an incorrect sequence number, so the victim ignores that response packet
And since the victim's machine ignored the host machine's response packet, the victim's sequence number count is off
Therefore, any packet the victim tries to send to the host machine will have an incorrect sequence number as well, causing the host machine to ignore it
In this case, both legitimate sides of the connection have incorrect sequence numbers, resulting in a desynchronized state
And since the attacker sent out the first spoofed packet that caused all this chaos, it can keep track of sequence numbers and continue spoofing packets from the victim's IP address to the host machine
This lets the attacker continue communicationg with the host machine while the victim's connection hangs
