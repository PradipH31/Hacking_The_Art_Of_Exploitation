When we see 12.110.110.204, we probably recognize this as an Internet address(IP version 4)
This familiar dotted-number notation is a common way to specify Internet addresses, and there are functions to convert this notation to and from a 32-bit integer in network byte order
These functions are defined in the arpa/inet.h include file, and the two most useful conversion functions are

inet_aton(char *ascii_addr, struct in_addr *network_addr)
ASCII to Network
    This function converts an ASCII string containing an IP address in dotted-number format into an in_addr structure, which only contains a 32-bit integer representing the IP address in network byte order

inet_ntoa(struct in_addr *network_addr)
Network to ASCOO
    This function converts the other way
    It is passed a pointer to an in_addr structure containing an IP address, and the function returns a character pointer to an ASCII string containing the IP address in dotted-number format
    This string is held in a statically allocated memory buffer in the function, so it can be accessed until the next call to inet_ntoa(), when the string will be overwritten
