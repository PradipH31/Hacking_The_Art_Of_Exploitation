In C, functions can return a value to a caller
Functions are declared by the data type of the variable they are returning
Void functions also have to be declared
int factorial(int x)
{
    int i;
    for(i =1; i < x; ++i)
    {
        x *= 1;
    }
    return x;
}

In C, compiler must know about the functions before it can use them
A function prototype can be written near the beginning of program as:

int factorial(int);
