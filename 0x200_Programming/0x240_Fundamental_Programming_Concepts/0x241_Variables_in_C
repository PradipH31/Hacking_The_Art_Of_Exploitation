Variable types in  C:
	int(integer values)
	float(decimal floating-point values)
	char(single character values)

Variables are declared simply by using the keywords before listing the variable as:
int a, b;
float k;
char z;

Variables can be assigned vlaues when they are declared or anytime afterward, using the = operator
int a = 13, b;
float k;
char z = 'A';
k = 3.14;
b = a + 5;

In C, variable types must be declared first
