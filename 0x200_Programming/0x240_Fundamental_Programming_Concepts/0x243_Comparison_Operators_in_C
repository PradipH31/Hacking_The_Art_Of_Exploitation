Conditional Statements require some sort of comparison operator like
Less than       <
Greater than    >
Less than or equal to       <=
Greater than or equal to    >=
Equal to        ==
Not equal to    !=

! denotes not and can invert expressions

OR      ||
AND     &&

C doesn't have any Boolean operators, so any nonzero value is considered true and zero is considered false
Comparison operators return values in 1 and 0 when true and false
