The main execution of a C program begins in the main() function
Any text following two forward slashes(//) is a comment, ignored by the compiler

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int i;
    for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)    //Loop 10 times
    {
        printf("Hello, world!\n");    //put the strig to the output
    }
    return 0;    //Tell OS the program exited without errors
}

The first line tells the compiler to include headers for a standard input/output (I/O) library named stdio
The header file is added to the program when it is compiled
It is located at /usr/include/stdio.h and defines several constants and function prototypes for corresponding functions in the standard I/O library
Since the main() function uses the printf() function from the standard I/O library, a function prototype is needed for printf() before it can be used
The prototype is included in the stdio.h header file

The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is a free C compiler that translates C into machine language that a processor can understand
The outputted translation is an executable binary file called a.out by default
