In the book, the author uses puts, but in the live CD, there is printf
The compiler uses whatever it decides better(in terms of security, efficiency, etc.)
When calling printf with no format, printf is not needed
So, the author uses put


echo "Files" > test.txt
hexdump test.txt 
6946 656c 0a73
hexdump test.txt -C
46 69 6c 65 73 0a                |Files.|
The hex code of F(as per ASCII) is 46 and i is 69
The above way is how the processor stores the values
In the hexdump of 2 bytes, the order is reversed
This system reads the lowest value first while reading the value of 2bytes(In a byte, the lowest value is the value at the last place like 10101101) and stores it in the same way
This would be interpreted in opposite way by other systems that use Big-endian byte order
