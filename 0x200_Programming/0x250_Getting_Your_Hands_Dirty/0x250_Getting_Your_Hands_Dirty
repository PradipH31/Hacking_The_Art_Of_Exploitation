The main execution of a C program begins in the main() function
Any text following two forward slashes(//) is a comment, ignored by the compiler

The first line tells the compiler to include headers for a standard input/output (I/O) library named stdio
The header file is added to the program when it is compiled
It is located at /usr/include/stdio.h and defines several constants and function prototypes for corresponding functions in the standard I/O library
Since the main() function uses the printf() function from the standard I/O library, a function prototype is needed for printf() before it can be used
The prototype is included in the stdio.h header file
