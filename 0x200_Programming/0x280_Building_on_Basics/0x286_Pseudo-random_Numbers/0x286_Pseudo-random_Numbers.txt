Since computers are determiistic machines, it is impossible for them to produce truly random numbers
But many applications require some form of randomness
The pseudo-random number generator functions fill this need by generating a stream of numbers that is psuedo-random
These functions can produce a seemingly random sequence of numbers started from a seed number; however, the same exact sequence can be generated again with the same seed
Deterministic machines cannot produce true randomness, but if the seed value of the pseudo-random generation function isn't known, the sequence will seem random
The generator must be seeded with a value using the function srand(), and form that point on, the function rand() will return a pseudo-random number, form 0 to RAND_MAX
These functions and RAND_MAX are defined in stdlib.h
While the numbers rand() returns will appear to be random, they are dependent on the seed value provided to srand()
To maintain pseudo-randomness between subsequent program executions, the randomizer must be seeded with a different value each time
One common practice is to use the number of seconds since epoch(returned from the time() function)

The program's output just displays random numbers
Pseudo-randomness can also be used for more complex programs
